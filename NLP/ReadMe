## Documentation and Tutorial: Text Classification using XLM-Roberta with Hyperparameter Tuning

This code provides an example of how to perform text classification using the XLM-Roberta model with hyperparameter tuning. It demonstrates the process of loading the 20 Newsgroups dataset, preprocessing the data, tokenizing the text using XLM-Roberta tokenizer, creating a TensorFlow dataset, defining a hyperparameter search space, and performing hyperparameter tuning using the Kerastuner library.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required packages: pandas, numpy, tensorflow, scikit-learn, transformers, kerastuner

### Installation
Install the required packages using the following command:
```
pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn transformers keras-tuner
```

### Code Explanation
The code can be divided into the following sections:

1. **Importing the Required Libraries**:
   - pandas: Data manipulation library
   - numpy: Numerical computing library
   - tensorflow: Deep learning framework
   - sklearn.datasets: Library for loading datasets
   - sklearn.model_selection: Library for splitting data into training and testing sets
   - sklearn.metrics: Library for evaluating model performance
   - transformers: Library for working with transformer models
   - kerastuner: Library for hyperparameter tuning
   
2. **Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset**:
   - The 20 Newsgroups dataset is loaded using the `fetch_20newsgroups` function from `sklearn.datasets`.
   - The dataset is converted into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
   - The data is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from `sklearn.model_selection`.
   
3. **Tokenization and Encoding**:
   - The XLM-Roberta tokenizer is initialized using `XLMRobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained`.
   - The text data is tokenized and encoded using the tokenizer's `encode_batch` method. Both training and testing data are encoded separately.
   - The encoded data is converted into TensorFlow datasets using the `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` method.
   
4. **HyperModel Definition**:
   - A custom hypermodel class, `MyHyperModel`, is defined by subclassing `kerastuner.HyperModel`.
   - The `build` method of the hypermodel is implemented to define the model architecture based on hyperparameters.
   - In this case, the architecture includes a pre-trained XLM-Roberta model, global average pooling, dropout layer, and a dense output layer.
   
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - An instance of the defined hypermodel is created.
   - The `RandomSearch` tuner from `kerastuner` is initialized, specifying the hypermodel, optimization objective, and search space.
   - The tuner performs a hyperparameter search using `tuner.search`, using the training and validation datasets, and for a specified number of epochs.
   
6. **Saving the Best Model**:
   - The best model obtained from the tuner is retrieved using `tuner.get_best_models`.
   - The best model is saved to a file using `best_model.save`.

### Tutorial Steps

1. Install the required packages by running `pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn transformers keras-tuner` in your terminal.

2. Copy the code into a Python script or Jupyter Notebook.

3. Run the script or notebook.

4. The code will load the 20 Newsgroups dataset, preprocess the data, tokenize and encode the text, and perform hyperparameter tuning using the defined hypermodel.

5. After the hyperparameter tuning process, the best
